# Exercise 3 – Tic-Tac-Toe (Two-browser Version)

This is a browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe game designed for Exercise 3. It supports two players on different browsers using a shared JSON file.

## Features
- Shared game state via File System Access API
- Two-browser sync
- Highlights winning line
- Auto-refresh on window focus

## How to Use
1. Open the game in one browser and click **Load** to choose or create a `state.json` file.
2. Open the same game in another browser, click **Load**, and select the same file.
3. Play alternately – changes are reflected in both browsers.

> Note: Each user must select the same `state.json` (stored locally).

Let me know if you'd like help customizing that or adding a `LICENSE`.
